This is a test file for the Tyra file watcher system.

The file watcher should automatically detect this file and process it through the document ingestion pipeline.

Once processed, this content will be embedded and stored in the memory system, making it searchable via memory queries.

This test verifies that the file watcher integration is working correctly.
